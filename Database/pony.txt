My little pony, my little pony
What is friendship all about
My little pony, my little pony
Friendship is magic
I used to wonder what friendship could be
(My little pony)
Until you all shared its magic with me
When I was young I was too busy to make any friends
Such silliness did not seem worth the effort it expends
But my little ponies, you opened up my eyes
And now the truth is crystal clear, as splendid summer skies
And it's such a wonderful surprise
I used to wonder what friendship could be
(My little pony)
Until you all shared its magic with me
When danger makes me want to hide, you'll Rainbow Dash to my side
Kindness is never in short supply, once smitten twice Fluttershy
For honesty no pony can deny, you are the Applejack of my eye
A heart that shines so beautiful, a Rarity to come by
And you all make fun and laughter as easy as Pinkie Pie
I used to wonder what friendship could be
(My little pony)
Until you all shared its magic with me
Our friendship's magic and it's growing all the time
A new adventure waits for us each day is yours and mine
We'll make it special every time
We'll make it special every time
What a wonderful wonder friendship brings
(My little pony)
Do you know you're all my very best
Friends, you're my very best
(Friends!) Friends, you're my very best
(Friends!) Friends, you're my very best
(Friends!) Friends
