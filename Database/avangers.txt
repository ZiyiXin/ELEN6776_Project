[Verse 1: Robert Downey Jr.]
Here's the story
Of a playboy genius
Who was gearing up to form some sort of crew

[Scarlett Johansson]
One's a former Russian spy

[Chris Hemsworth]
A god of thunder

[Chris Evans]
One fought in World War II

[Chris Pratt]
It's the story
Of a handsome star-lord
Like the greatest, to ever walk the Earth (by far)

[Anthony Mackie]
And a falcon

[Benedict Cumberbatch]
A magic doctor

[Chadwick Boseman]
Wakanda forever
**All**
So then one day all the heroes were assembled
To fight a villain who packed much more than a punch
And this group
Was labeled the Avengers
That's the way we all became the Marvel Bunch
The Marvel Bunch
The Marvel Bunch
That's the way we became the Marvel Bunch

[Tom Hiddleston]
Ah, hello brother

[Chris Hemsworth]
Shut up!
