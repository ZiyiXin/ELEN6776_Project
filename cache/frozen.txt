THE SNOW GLOWS WHITE
ON THE MOUNTAIN TONIGHT
NOT A FOOTPRINT TO BE SEEN
A KINGDOM OF ISOLATION
AND IT LOOKS LIKE I'M THE QUEEN
THE WIND IS HOWLING
LIKE THIS SWIRLING STORM INSIDE
COULDN'T KEEP IT IN
HEAVEN KNOWS I TRIED...
(The SNOW CHORUS enters, one by one. Their moves are beautiful, fluid.)
DON'T LET THEM IN
DON'T LET THEM SEE
BE THE GOOD GIRL YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE
CONCEAL
DON'T FEEL
DON'T LET THEM KNOW
WELL, NOW THEY KNOW
LET IT GO, LET IT GO
CAN'T HOLD IT BACK ANYMORE
LET IT GO, LET IT GO
TURN AWAY AND SLAM THE DOOR
I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO SAY
LET THE STORM RAGE ON
THE COLD NEVER BOTHERED ME ANYWAY
IT'S FUNNY HOW SOME DISTANCE
MAKES EVERYTHING SEEM SMALL
AND THE FEARS THAT ONCE CONTROLLED ME
CAN'T GET TO ME AT ALL
IT'S TIME TO SEE
WHAT I CAN DO
TO TEST THE LIMITS AND BREAK THROUGH
NO RIGHT, NO WRONG
NO RULES FOR ME
I'M FREE!
LET IT GO! LET IT GO!
I AM ONE WITH THE WIND AND SKY
LET IT GO! LET IT GO!
YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME CRY
HERE, I STAND, AND HERE, I'LL STAY
LET THE STORM RAGE ON...
